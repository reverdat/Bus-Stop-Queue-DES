	abstract = {The Weibull distribution is frequently used in reliability applications. Many diﬀerent methods of estimating the parameters and important functions of the parameters (e.g. quantiles and failure probabilities) have been suggested. Maximum likelihood and median rank regression methods are most commonly used today. Largely because of conﬂicting results from diﬀerent studies that have been conducted to investigate the properties of these estimators, there are sharp diﬀerences of opinion on which method should be used. The purpose of this paper is to report on the results of our simulation study, to provide insight into the diﬀerences between the competing methods, and to resolve the diﬀerences among the previous studies.},

	abstract = {Least-squares estimation ({LSE}) based on Weibull probability plot ({WPP}) is the most basic method for estimating the Weibull parameters. The common procedure of this method is using the least-squares regression of Y on X, i.e. minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical residuals, to fit a straight line to the data points on {WPP} and then calculate the {LS} estimators. This method is known to be biased. In the existing literature the least-squares regression of X on Y, i.e. minimizing the sum of squares of the horizontal residuals, has been used by the Weibull researchers. This motivated us to carry out this comparison between the estimators of the two {LS} regression methods using intensive Monte Carlo simulations. Both complete and censored data are examined. Surprisingly, the result shows that {LS} Y on X performs better for small, complete samples, while the {LS} X on Y performs better in other cases in view of bias of the estimators. The two methods are also compared in terms of other model statistics. In general, when the shape parameter is less than one, {LS} Y on X provides a better model; otherwise, {LS} X on Y tends to be better.},

	abstract = {Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudo-random sampling. A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some “truth” (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“{ADEMP}”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},
